          "body": "Dear Council Member,\\n\\nAs a Fremont resident, I'm reaching out to express my deep concern over the potential adoption of biased resolutions regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict. I urge you to vote NO on the proposed ceasefire resolution.\\n\\nRecent events in the Bay Area have introduced us to heightened antisemitism and Islamophobia. Introducing one-sided narratives will only exacerbate these tensions, dividing our community further. We have already seen that these ceasefire discussions do not prevent discord: they inflame it. Ceasefire discussions in Oakland, Richmond, and the surrounding cities have led to long hours of chaotic public comments containing hate speech. SF Mayor London Breed has condemned a similar ceasefire resolution, labeling it ‘inflammatory and divisive’. And we see that amplifying hatred has immediate consequences: Jewish families have begun to move their children out of Oakland public schools as a result of rising antisemitism stoked by discussions such as these.\\n\\nDuring this time of rising hate and antisemitism, I’m asking you to lead with empathy and ensure all local residents feel supported and welcomed. The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has deeply impacted many members of our community. Many of us are in mourning. Inaccurate and one-sided resolutions will not solve the conflict or bring us any closer to peace. We must bring our community together – not pull ourselves apart. Please vote NO on the proposed ceasefire resolution.\\n\\nThank you,"
